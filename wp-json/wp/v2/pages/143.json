Nigeria\u2019s GDP then totaled over 510 billion dollars. The GDP has also been registering an impressive growth rate in recent years, exceeding 6% annually. Nigeria is one of Africa\u2019s most attractive destinations for investors. Besides the diverse natural resources it is endowed with, Nigeria disposes of a huge human capital, with trained and qualified professionals readily available at competitive costs in the employment market. Investors would also be impressed by the array of investment incentives they can take advantage of in various sectors. Nigeria, investors would quickly discover, is a market characterised by the high return on investment it offers. Nigeria\u2019s investment environment is supported by strong and reliable financial institutions and government agencies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NIGERIAN INVESTMENT PROMOTION COMMISSION<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) is a Federal Agency charged, among others, with coordinating, monitoring and providing necessary assistance and guidance for the establishment and operation of enterprises in Nigeria. It is not only the gateway to investment in Nigeria for foreign investors and Nigerian investors seeking to engage in value-added activities in their country, but also Nigeria\u2019s window to the international investment world. It is a Federal Agency with a perpetual succession and a common seal. NIPC collects, collates, analyze and disseminates information and data on investment opportunities and sources of capital. It advises on business partnership and identifies specific projects in which potential investors can be solicited to participate.<\/p>\n<p>The NIPC registers and keeps records of all companies to which the NIPC Act applies. It maintains the interaction between investors and ministries, government departments and agencies, financial institutions and other authorities concerned with investments. It anchors the One-Stop Investment Centre (OSIC) which interfaces with companies on incorporation and registration matters.\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nipc.gov.ng\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.nipc.gov.ng<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>ONE STOP INVESTMENT CENTRE-OSIC<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Established in 2006 within the framework of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), One-Stop Investment Centre (OSIC), as its name indicates, is an organ set up to facilitate investment in all sectors of Nigeria\u2019s economy. It provides a single portal or contact point for sourcing information and carrying out the necessary formalities with a view to obtaining all the required approvals before the operation of a business. OSIC brings together the divers services normally provided separately by various government agencies involved in company registration and operations formalities. It is a point of convergence for coordinated and streamlined action. The centre also assists existing and prospective investors with statistical data and information on the Nigerian economy, investment climate, legal and regulatory framework, as well as sector and industry- specific information, to facilitate the making of informed business decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Services offered by OSIC include:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Providing general information and data on Nigeria\u2019s economy, as well as advisory services on investment opportunities;<br \/>\n\u2022Granting of business entry approvals, permits and authorisations;<br \/>\n\u2022Assisting with company incorporation and registration;<br \/>\n\u2022Facilitating post-entry approvals, licences and other sector-specific permits with statutory government agencies with extant mandate;<br \/>\n\u2022 Assisting with tax registration and clearance;<br \/>\n\u2022 Assisting with work permit, expatriate quota and other immigration formalities;<br \/>\n\u2022 Facilitating Customs clearance for investment projects. OSIC brings together, for speedy service delivery, several agencies and ministries, among others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BUSINESS INCORPORATION AND REGISTRATION: A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All businesses in Nigeria must be registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission before going formally into operation. Registration can take various forms as follows, depending on the type of business:<br \/>\n\u2022Private Limited Liability Company (Ltd)<br \/>\n\u2022Public Limited Company (PLC)<br \/>\n\u2022Unlimited Company<br \/>\n\u2022Company Limited by Guarantee<br \/>\n\u2022Subsidiary or Branch of a foreign company<br \/>\n\u2022Partnership or Joint Venture<br \/>\n\u2022Sole Proprietorship<br \/>\n\u2022Incorporated Trustees (religious, charitable, philanthropic or cultural)<br \/>\n\u2022 Representative Office (in special cases)<\/p>\n<p>A minimum share capital of Ten Thousand Naira (N10 000) is required to set up a private company (Limited Liability). For a Public Company (PLC) the required minimum share capital is five hundred thousand naira, (500,000 Naira). A minimum subscription of 25% of the authorised capital is also required at the point of incorporation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Company Registration Process<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Company Registration process has been streamlined and simplified to enhance efficiency and rapidity, with the establishment of the One-Stop Investment Centre (OSIC), located in the premises of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC). Through the services of OSIC, companies can now be registered in a matter of days. However, companies which so wish can engage the services of a legal counsel to perform the registration formalities, although this may attract a substantial fee. The following are the main steps in the process of company registration:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Prepare the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the proposed company.<br \/>\n\u2022 Conduct at the Corporate Affairs Commission availability search on the proposed name of the company; once the company name is approved, a set of incorporation forms should be purchased and filled; the registration of business name can be conducted without the assistance of a legal practitioner and attracts a fee of 10,000 Naira (Ten Thousand Naira).<br \/>\n\u2022 Submit appropriate documents to the Federal Inland Revenue Service for payment of stamp duties and stamping.<br \/>\n\u2022 Submit the completed and stamped documents with together with the corresponding permits to the CAC for verification and final approval.<br \/>\n\u2022The Certificate of Incorporation is then issued, with the accompanying Certified True Copies of relevant documents to the investor. All post-registration processes are done at the Head Office of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) where all files are kept in safe custody and data entered on the CAC records.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Incorporating and Operating a foreign Company<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Foreign companies wishing to establish and operate in Nigeria must accomplish required formalities for the local incorporation of the Nigerian branch or subsidiary, or autonomous business entity. Prior registration must be done before embarking on any business activity. An investor may, however, give power of attorney to a solicitor for a limited period of time during which incorporation is being processed. This arrangement would then be indicated in the relevant incorporation documents, specifying that the solicitor, whose name appears therein, is merely acting as an \u201cAgent\u201d or \u201cPrincipal\u201d. The appointed solicitor ceases to function in the specified capacity upon the completion of the registration formalities. The locally incorporated company must then register with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) before commencing formal operations. It may also apply to NIPC for other investment approvals (expatriate quota, etc.) and incentives ((Pioneer Status, etc.).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Exemption from Incorporation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Where applicable, exemption from local incorporation may be granted in accordance with Section 56 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act. Application to this effect should be addressed to the National Council of Ministers, through the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF). The National Council of Ministers eventually grants the exemption in the terms it deems fit. Below are the concerned categories of businesses:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Foreign Companies which are in Nigeria for the execution of a specific individual loan project on behalf of a donor country or an international organisation;<br \/>\n\u2022 Foreign government-owned companies engaged solely in export promotion activities; \u2022 Engineering consultants and technical experts on any individual specialist project\u00a0 under contract with any of the governments of the Federation or any of their agencies or with any other body or person, where such contract has been approved by the government.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CORPORATE AFFAIRS COMMISSION (CAC)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) was established by the Companies and Allied Matters Act (1990) as an autonomous body to regulate the formation and management of companies in Nigeria. The Commission dispenses a wide range of services before, during and after incorporation and registration of business enterprises. It administers the Companies and Allied Matters Act promulgated in 1990 and commonly called the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d. It is headed by a Registrar General\/ Chief Executive Officer.<\/p>\n<p>Among the functions and services offered by the Corporate Affairs Commission Headquarters are:<br \/>\n\u2022 Registration of business name and incorporation of companies;<br \/>\n\u2022 Registration of Incorporated Trustees;<br \/>\n\u2022 Same Day Incorporation Services, whereby, under certain conditions, companies can be registered within one day;<br \/>\n\u2022 Issuance of True Certified Copies of filed company documents;<br \/>\n\u2022 Registration of share capital increases, mortgages, etc.;<br \/>\n\u2022 Processing the statutory filings of Annual Returns, increase, changes in the memo and articles, addresses, etc.<br \/>\n\u2022 Management and winding- up of companies.<\/p>\n<p>The Corporate Affairs Commission has branch offices in all the 36 states of the Federation.

However, such an office can only serve as a pro- motional and liaison office and its local expenses have to be covered by the foreign company. It cannot engage in business activities or conclude contracts or open or negotiate any letters of credit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Legislation On Investment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Two principal laws govern investment in Nigeria, with emphasis on foreign investment: \u2022The Nigerian Investment Promotion Act N\u00b0 16 of 1995;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022The Foreign Exchange (Monitoring and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act N\u00b017 of 1995. The functions Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), as stipulated by the NIPC Act 16, 1995, are wide-ranging and include coordinating, monitoring, encouraging and providing necessary assistance to and guidance for the establishment and operation of businesses in Nigeria. The NIPC is also to promote investment in and outside Nigeria through effective means. The highlights of the above- mentioned Acts (N\u00b016 and N\u00b0 17 of 1995) with regards to investment are as follows:<br \/>\n\u2022 A foreigner may invest and participate in the operation of any enterprise in Nigeria; \u2022An enterprise in which foreign participation is permitted shall, after its incorporation, be registered with the NIPC;<br \/>\n\u2022 A foreign enterprise may buy shares of any Nigerian enterprise in any convertible currency;<br \/>\n\u2022 A foreign investor in a registered enterprise is guaranteed unconditional transferability of funds through an authorised dealer, in any convertible currency, be it: \u2013 dividends or profit (net of taxes) attributable to the investment; \u2013 payments in respect of loan servicing, where a foreign loan has been obtained; \u2013 proceeds (net of taxes and other obligations) in the event of sale or liquidation of enterprise or any interest attributable to the investment; \u2013 the entire capital can be transferred should the investor decide to relocate elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Investment\u00a0 Protection<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The legislation on investment also provides solid assurance regarding the protection of investment. It guards against nationalisation or expropriation of an enterprise by the government and the compulsory dispossession of an investor of his\/her interest in the capital of an enterprise, whether wholly or in part. It guards against the acquisition of an enterprise by the government unless the such an acquisition is in the best interest of a public purpose, in which case adequate compensation must be paid promptly, with authorisation for full repatriation of the proceeds in convertible currency, where applicable. The law also gives the investor the right of access to the courts for determination of his\/her interest of right and the compensation to which he\/she is entitled.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Countries willing to invest in Nigeria may choose to enter into bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (IPPA) with the Nigerian government. Deregulation of Equity Structure in Nigerian Enterprises<br \/>\nThe Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) Act N\u00b0 16 of 1995 has effectively abolished any restrictions in respect of the limits of foreign shareholding in an enterprise registered in Nigeria. However, certain categories of enterprises remain subject to authorisation for non-Nigerians:<br \/>\n\u2022 Production of arms and ammunition;<br \/>\n\u2022 Production of and dealing innarcotics and psychotropic substances;<br \/>\n\u2022 Manufacture of military and paramilitary wears and accoutrements;<br \/>\n\u2022 Participating in coastal and inland shipping.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ROLE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are the primary institutions regulating the Nigerian financial system as regards investment. The financial system comprises bank and non-bank institutions. Other institutions involved in the regulation of the financial system include the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) and the National Board for Community Banks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FEDERAL MINISTRY OF FINANCE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) is the central regulatory organ of the Nigerian financial system.\u00a0 It advises the Federal Government on its fiscal policies and operations, and monetary matters generally, in con- junction with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fmf.gov.ng\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.fmf.gov.ng<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is the apex regulatory authority of the financial system established in 1958, the Bank promotes monetary stability and a sound financial system.
