										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Honourable Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yusuf M. Tuggar (OON) received in audience H.E Chen Xiaodong, Vice Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic of China today 25th July, 2024. Both Ministers discussed bilateral matters bordering on the fostering of greater cooperation in the areas of trade and economic relations. They further deliberated on preparations for the upcoming ninth Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit holding in Beijing from 3 &#8211; 8 September, 2024. The Summit takes place every three years with China and Africa alternating as hosts. The inaugural Summit was held in Beijing in 2000. Although conceived on the Ministerial engagement, three of the last eight Sessions were elevated to a China-Africa Leaders’ Summit: the 3rd in 2006 held in Beijing, the 6th in 2015 held in Johannesburg and the 7th in 2018 also held in Beijing. In 2021, the forum was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
